# gridium-project

NOTE: I had to create an Express server proxy to get around the CORS policy of the API endpoints. 

Instructions:
- Clone the repository
- Open a bash terminal and navigate to the 'gridium-project' folder
- Install dependencies by running `npm install`
- Start the server locally on port 5000 by running the command `npm start`
- you should see 'listening on port 5000'
- Navigate to http://localhost:5000/ in your browser
- Hope you like the app!

IF ABOVE DOES NOT WORK, RUN THE CLIENT SEPARATELY BY DOING THE FOLLOWING
- Open another terminal
- Navigate to the 'gridium-challenge' folder
- Run `npm install`
- Start the client on http://localhost:3000/ by running the command `npm run start`
- Open browser and enter http://localhost:3000/ in the url
- Hope you like the app!
